Sources I used for the front end and back end:
At UZH I did a similar project in a group of 5, where each person would contribute equally. The code can be found at https://github.com/NicoSB/sopra-fs16-group12. However, I merely used it as a template.
Additionally I looked at multiple spring boot tutorials for android and rest.
